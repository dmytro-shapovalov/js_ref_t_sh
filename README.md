This repo is a solution for a test task.

Tasks were:

1. Refactor the code.
2. Use OOP style.
3. Use functional style.
4. Use procedural style.

Please consider `refactor_proc.js` to be the answer to 1 and 4. `oop.js` is the 2.
As for 3, functional approach, I'm don't really have any skills in functional, so no answer here.

Thanks.
